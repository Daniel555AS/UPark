# UPark – Digital Parking Management System

## Problem Statement
The absence of a specific system for managing the parking services at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana – Bucaramanga Campus has resulted in deficiencies in controlling and organizing the available spaces, which increases the perception of insecurity among users. The lack of an appropriate mechanism hinders monitoring, traffic flow management, and incident prevention, negatively affecting the experience and satisfaction of the university community.

## General Objective
To implement a comprehensive software solution for the management of parking facilities at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana – Bucaramanga Campus, by integrating Java and MySQL technologies with principles of systems analysis and design, in order to streamline operational processes, enhance user experience, and improve the overall perception of control and security within the campus environment.

## Specific Objectives
* To identify the functional and non-functional requirements of the parking management system through user observations, in order to establish a clear development roadmap aligned with campus needs.
* To develop the software components of the parking management system using Java, MySQL, and iterative SCRUM sprints, in order to deliver a functional solution that effectively addresses the identified campus parking needs.
* To document the progress and results of each development sprint using SCRUM artifacts such as the product backlog, sprint backlog, and sprint reviews, in order to ensure traceability, team alignment, and continuous improvement throughout the project.

## Project Overview
UPark is a software project developed at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana – Bucaramanga Campus as part of the Systems Analysis and Design course in the second semester of the Systems and Informatics Engineering program. The project aimed to apply theoretical engineering concepts to solve contextual problems within the university environment.

UPark is a software application developed to support the management of parking spaces at the university. It includes features for vehicle registration and exit management, visitor registration, license plate validation, and administrative and security management.

The system was developed using the Java programming language, with a graphical user interface built using Java Swing, and integrated with a MySQL database.
